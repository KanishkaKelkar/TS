1)	Conducted time series analysis to forecast and model trends in date and its respective value data, leveraging technique such as ARIMA.
2)	Preprocessed time-stamped datasets by handling missing values, smoothing and transforming data to ensure accuracy in the analysis.
3)	Performed trend analysis, seasonality decomposition and stationarity tests (e.g., ADF test) to better understand the dataâ€™s patterns and behavior over time.
4)	Applied feature engineering, such as lag variables to enhance the predictive power of the time series model.
5)	Implemented model tuning and validation using metrics like MSE (Mean Squared Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) to ensure accuracy and robustness.
6)	Visualized time series trends and forecast results using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn for clear actionable insights.
7)	Utilized the final model for accurate forecasting of future date values, assisting in decision-making processes and planning.
